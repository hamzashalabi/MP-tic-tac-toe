# tictactoe

A new Flutter project.
this project is an online tictactoe game with rooms that contains two players 
used flutter for frontend and socket_io_client for communication with server side 
used node for server and socket_io for server side coomunication with client side 
used monogo DB for database.

here are some takes after i have finished the project 
node's socket_io is rather moody sometimes and it requires great care when handled otherwise you 
might not find the error and especially if you have no experaince in java script (like me -_-).

flutter's provider is rather very great in data management in your flutter app but this is my first use 
so it is still a little bit confusing to me.

at the end this is my second flutter app and my first time using node so the code 
might be crude and not clean at so please forgive me
